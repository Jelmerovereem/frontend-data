Welcome to the readme of this repo!

## This course 
Frontend-data is a course that is part of the [TechTrack](https://cmda-tt.github.io/course-20-21/).
In this course, you learn to create visualizations from (external) data, how to clean and transform this data and use SVG and d3. ðŸ“ˆ

### Assignment
The overall assignment is to create a (static) data visualization with D3.js based on the datasets of the RDW(Netherlands Vehicle Authority). The client is the 'Volkskrant'. A Dutch newspaper with a website where they publish interactive articles.

### Learning goals
I'm thrilled to start working with D3.js! I've seen very very cool visualizations that blew me away, I can't wait to create awesome visualizations with it. ðŸŽ‰

* Understanding and working with D3  
* Cleaning data and write simple, but effective functions
* Improving my JavaScript skills and experience
* Write cleaner code and as efficient as possible.

### Concept
_For a more detailed version of the concept, visit [my wiki entry](https://github.com/Jelmerovereem/functional-programming/wiki/Concept-&-research-questions)._

The concept/theme for this data visualization is **the best way to park your car in the city**.  
The stakeholders for this theme are:
* automobilists
* other road users (cyclists, scooter drivers, etc.)
* parking managers
* township
* road workers

#### Main theme question
_What is the best way to park in the city throughout the Netherlands?_

I've devided this main question into 3 subquestions:  
1. What are the cheapest parking spots?  
2. Where are the most parking spots?  
3. Where are the available/free parking spots?

### Examples
I used the [Curran dataviz course](https://curran.github.io/dataviz-course-2018/) to learn the d3 skills.
See the folder curranDatavizCourse in this repo for the examples.
